    <p>The general discussion on the merits of games seems very similar to the general discussion regarding those of programming.</p>

<h3 id="programming-and-games-as-a-distraction-from-what-is-important">Programming and Games as a Distraction from "What is Important"</h3>

<p>"When will you stop playing games and get back to work?"</p>

<p>We often view games as a distraction, as a 'fun' respite from the cold realities of life and work. This is the mindset that led one of my colleagues to say "I just don't have time for games."</p>

<p>Nowadays, our technology-saturated culture is so focused on programming as a work-related pursuit that we can find it difficult to draw a parallel with programming, but I think "Stop sitting in front of a computer screen and go outside!" is still a common sentiment.</p>

<h3 id="gamesprogramming-as-treatment">Games/Programming as Treatment</h3>

<p>In <a href="http://worrydream.com/MeanwhileAtCodeOrg/"><em>meanwhile, at code.org</em></a>, Bret Victor bemoans the corruption of Seymour Papert's thoughts on programming and pedagogy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Papert's goal was to give children a path to powerful mathematical
ideas, and he saw programming as a better carrier of the ideas than
pencil-and-paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Others misinterpret him as making the dubious claim that
<strong>simply learning to program will make you think better</strong>.
Papert is astonished that anyone would think he was saying that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much of the work on <em>gamification of education</em> takes a similar approach, treating games as a "more fun" or less teacher-intensive method to transmit knowledge through rote memorization and award structures supported by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber">Skinner box</a> mechanics.</p>

<h3 id="gamesprogramming-and-encoded-ideas">Games/Programming and Encoded Ideas</h3>

<p>Bret Victor:
&gt; Papert explains that programming can serve as a medium in which
&gt; powerful ideas can be brought within reach. But the focus, of course,
&gt; must be on the powerful ideas, not the programming itself.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.arts.rpi.edu/~ruiz/EGDFall10/readings/RhetoricVideoGames_Bogost.pdf">The Rhetoric of Video Games</a>, Ian Bogost argues that games represent a powerful way of representing ideas that other media cannot as readily communicate.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the connection between games and programming in discourse isn't truly surprising, because both involve encoding and exploring procedural behavior. In the strictest sense, all games are programs, but that fact is easy to forget because we usually think of programs as computer software while games more readily call to mind social or physical interactions. Nonetheless, I think recognizing something in one domain can help us reconsider our views on the other.</p>
