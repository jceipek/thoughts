    <p>What constitutes a <em>game</em>? What constitutes <em>play</em>?</p>

<p>Philosophers, academics, and game creators have been debating the answers to questions of this ilk for a very long time.</p>

<p>In <em>Rules of Play</em>, Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman describe a game as 
&gt; a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict,
&gt; defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome.</p>

<p>In <em>The Definition of Play, The Classification of Games</em>, Roger Caillois describes play via the properties <em>Free</em> (voluntary), <em>Separate</em> (with predefined limits of space and time), <em>Uncertain</em> (the results are not guaranteed beforehand), <em>Unproductive</em> (creating nothing of value during the course of the game and ending in a situation identical to that prior to the beginning of the game), <em>Governed by Rules</em>, and <em>Make-believe</em>.</p>

<p>Jesper Juul's definition of "game" (from <em>The Game, the Player, the World: Looking for a Heart of Gameness</em>) is
&gt; a rule-based formal system with a variable and quantifiable outcome,
&gt; where different outcomes are assigned different values, the player
&gt; exerts effort in order to influence the outcome, the player feels
&gt; attached to the outcome, and the consequences of the activity are
&gt; optional and negotiable.</p>

<p>There are so many conflicting definitions that Molleindustria created a <a href="http://www.gamedefinitions.com">whole site</a> devoted to game definitions.</p>

<p>The great variety suggests that it is futile to determine one true meaning for these terms; that they are simply ambiguous and context-dependent.</p>

<p>However, rather than ignoring them, I think that designers can think of them as artificial constraints to surmount.</p>

<p>For example, does an experience really have to have a "variable and quantifiable outcome" to be considered a game? Why not try to create an emotionally moving interactive experience that involves an emotional journey but doesn't vary in its outcome?</p>

<p>Does play truly have to be "unproductive"? What about games that involve creating lasting artifacts and social change?</p>

<p>Trying to envision experiences that challenge specific definitions seems like a fantastic way to develop games that have yet to be experienced.</p>
