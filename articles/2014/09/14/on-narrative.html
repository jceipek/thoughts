    <p>In 2002, Henry Jenkins published the article <em>Game Design as Narrative Architecture</em>. In it, he addresses many of my misgivings about the views Jesper Juul expresses in his <em>A Clash Between Games and Narrative</em> and <em>Games Telling Stories?</em></p>

<p>In the following decade, we have witnessed the emergence of many innovative experiences that have advanced the state of the art in many of the categories Jenkins proposes.</p>

<h3 id="transmedia-storytelling">Transmedia Storytelling</h3>
<p>Experience franchises spreading to diverse media is nothing new. Look no further than the superhero characters from comics appearing in books, movies, television, web-series, and games. More interesting is the phenomenon of interactive experiences that transcend media boundaries. A recent example is Google's Ingress, a worldwide multiplayer alternate reality game that enables player participation through smartphone-world interaction, online code breaking, and storytelling/partaking through online videos and social media.</p>

<h3 id="spatial-narratives">Spatial Narratives</h3>
<p><em>Gone Home</em> is a perfect example of what Jenkins calls a "Memory Palace," a place that players can explore at will, unravelling stories left in narrative fragments throughout a space. While <em>Gone Home</em> communicates one primary narrative, that of the protagonist's sister, it also contains several tangentially-related story threads involving the other members of the family.</p>

<h3 id="micronarratives">Micronarratives</h3>
<p>Most modern games, particularly big budget titles, embed many "memorable moments" into their games. Some of these are developed to the extent that they are known as "side-quests," with mostly self-contained, sometimes optional narrative arcs that may enhance the primary storyline or serve as exercises in world-building.</p>

<p>Punch Drunk's <em>Sleep No More</em> is particularly notable in this category. It encourages audiences to explore a mass of related but distinct narrative threads at their own pace as they follow actors and explore a physical three story building with maze-like passages.</p>

<h3 id="emergent-narratives">Emergent Narratives</h3>
<p>Unplanned narratives often emerge from games with large player-bases. The space game <em>Eve Online</em> is a prime example; it provides a sandbox-like simulation environment with enough constraints that players self-organize to take on roles in many different stories involving themes such as faction conflict, diplomacy, corporate espionage, and piracy.</p>

<p>It seems to me, however, that very few experiences explore smaller-scale emergent storytelling, especially in the category of single-player computer games with an emphasis on player choice. Some of the best games in this category (such as the fantastic <em>Spelunky</em>) involve procedurally generated worlds and enemies and explore few emotions unrelated to conquest.</p>
