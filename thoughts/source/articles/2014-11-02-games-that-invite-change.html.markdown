The element that substantially differentiates games from other media is the degree to which they enable and encourage audience participation. Games respond when the audience acts. We might say that paintings, film, and novels, also respond, in that each audience member brings a context and set of interpretations to these media forms. However, games are much more dynamic. The best games encourage players to experiment with the mechanics in as many different ways as possible. Jonathan Blow's game design philosophy revolves around guiding players to discover the deep emergent consequences of a simple and elegant ruleset.

While all games encourage interaction, some actually invite players to explore the consequences of modifying their systems, to add or remove rules and mechanics and to explore the implications of those changes. These games are inherently moddable.

On the other hand, some games are so compactly designed that changing them effectively would be very difficult. As I discussed [here](http://jceipek.com/thoughts/#2014/09/01-Set-System-Analysis), the card game _Set_ discourages modding because any alterations would oppose the simplicity and elegance of the core system design.

Recently, I've been working on a creative problem solving card game called _Evil Lairs for Dummies_. We designed it to be moddable, to have systems that beg the players to change them to see what will happen. However, we didn't frame the game in a way that invited this type of change; the players felt that they didn't have permission to mod the game.

In order for a game to truly invite change, I think it needs to be explicitly encouraged by the designers and the game systems.
