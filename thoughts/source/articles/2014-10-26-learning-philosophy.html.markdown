I have a personal philosophy that is all about learning: I can't be happy unless I'm doing it.

This notion is aligned with Raph Coster's arguments in _A Theory of Fun for Game Design_; he cites _Tic-Tac-Toe_ as an example of a game that is only fun for children until they learn to recognize the patterns in the game. Under trivial optimal play, every match will end in a stalemate, and the game becomes boring.

As media designers, we frequently struggle to create "engaging" content. One simple way to do this is to ensure that everything we create teaches something. Think of all the books we enjoy even more deeply when we reread them. We say things like "there are so many amazing things I missed when I read it the first time."

This is the essence of "deep", "strategic" play in great games: it's well-accepted that each time we play them, we find new strategies and new meaning in the game mechanics. However, games aren't just about mechanics, they are also about representation through visuals, audio, and other means. It should be obvious that representation and mechanics together influence what we (consciously or not) learn from games.

In a shooting game, it matters whether the entities we shoot are vicious demons (_Doom_, 1993) or unarmed civilians (_Hatred_, planned 2015).

When designing a game, there is a big tendency to rely on defaults, on representations that match unconscious cultural or social stereotypes. The problem with that approach is that the resulting games have a tendency to have white cisgender male characters, to disempower and objectify female characters, and to portray black characters as agents of violence.

In _The Power of Play: The Portrayal and Performance of Race in Video Games_, Everett and Watkins examine some of negative stereotypes reinforced by racial representation in games.

If we can use representations to teach and games are fun and engaging when we can learn from them, won't games be all the more engaging if the representations in them introduce us to new contexts?
