In 2002, Henry Jenkins published the article _Game Design as Narrative Architecture_. In it, he addresses many of my misgivings about the views Jesper Juul expresses in his _A Clash Between Games and Narrative_ and _Games Telling Stories?_

In the following decade, we have witnessed the emergence of many innovative experiences that have advanced the state of the art in many of the categories Jenkins proposes.

### Transmedia Storytelling
Experience franchises spreading to diverse media is nothing new. Look no further than the superhero characters from comics appearing in books, movies, television, web-series, and games. More interesting is the phenomenon of interactive experiences that transcend media boundaries. A recent example is Google's Ingress, a worldwide multiplayer alternate reality game that enables player participation through smartphone-world interaction, online code breaking, and storytelling/partaking through online videos and social media.

### Spatial Narratives
_Gone Home_ is a perfect example of what Jenkins calls a "Memory Palace," a place that players can explore at will, unravelling stories left in narrative fragments throughout a space. While _Gone Home_ communicates one primary narrative, that of the protagonist's sister, it also contains several tangentially-related story threads involving the other members of the family.

### Micronarratives
Most modern games, particularly big budget titles, embed many "memorable moments" into their games. Some of these are developed to the extent that they are known as "side-quests," with mostly self-contained, sometimes optional narrative arcs that may enhance the primary storyline or serve as exercises in world-building.

Punch Drunk's _Sleep No More_ is particularly notable in this category. It encourages audiences to explore a mass of related but distinct narrative threads at their own pace as they follow actors and explore a physical three story building with maze-like passages.

### Emergent Narratives
Unplanned narratives often emerge from games with large player-bases. The space game _Eve Online_ is a prime example; it provides a sandbox-like simulation environment with enough constraints that players self-organize to take on roles in many different stories involving themes such as faction conflict, diplomacy, corporate espionage, and piracy.

It seems to me, however, that very few experiences explore smaller-scale emergent storytelling, especially in the category of single-player computer games with an emphasis on player choice. Some of the best games in this category (such as the fantastic _Spelunky_) involve procedurally generated worlds and enemies and explore few emotions unrelated to conquest.
