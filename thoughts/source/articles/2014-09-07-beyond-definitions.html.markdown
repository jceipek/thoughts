What constitutes a _game_? What constitutes _play_?

Philosophers, academics, and game creators have been debating the answers to questions of this ilk for a very long time.

In _Rules of Play_, Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman describe a game as

> a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict,
> defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome.

In _The Definition of Play, The Classification of Games_, Roger Caillois describes play via the properties *Free* (voluntary), *Separate* (with predefined limits of space and time), *Uncertain* (the results are not guaranteed beforehand), *Unproductive* (creating nothing of value during the course of the game and ending in a situation identical to that prior to the beginning of the game), *Governed by Rules*, and *Make-believe*.

Jesper Juul's definition of "game" (from _The Game, the Player, the World: Looking for a Heart of Gameness_) is

> a rule-based formal system with a variable and quantifiable outcome,
> where different outcomes are assigned different values, the player
> exerts effort in order to influence the outcome, the player feels
> attached to the outcome, and the consequences of the activity are
> optional and negotiable.

There are so many conflicting definitions that Molleindustria created a [whole site](http://www.gamedefinitions.com) devoted to game definitions.

The great variety suggests that it is futile to determine one true meaning for these terms; that they are simply ambiguous and context-dependent.

However, rather than ignoring them, I think that designers can think of them as artificial constraints to surmount.

For example, does an experience really have to have a "variable and quantifiable outcome" to be considered a game? Why not try to create an emotionally moving interactive experience that involves an emotional journey but doesn't vary in its outcome?

Does play truly have to be "unproductive"? What about games that involve creating lasting artifacts and social change?

Trying to envision experiences that challenge specific definitions seems like a fantastic way to develop games that have yet to be experienced.
